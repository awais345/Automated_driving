# Autonomous_driving
This repository contains the analysis of disengagement reports from self-driving vehicle testing conducted in California between December 1, 2018, and November 30, 2019. The dataset provides valuable insights into the challenges faced by autonomous technology during testing on public roads.

# Dataset Description
The dataset includes disengagement reports and autonomous miles traveled by permit holders who reported testing activity in California. It covers various aspects of each disengagement, including:

Manufacturer: The company responsible for the self-driving vehicle.
Permit Number: Unique identifier for the testing permit.
Date: The date of the reported disengagement.
VIN Number: Vehicle Identification Number associated with the disengagement.
Vehicle Capability: Indicates if the vehicle is capable of operating without a driver.
Driver Presence: Indicates whether a driver was present during the disengagement.
Disengagement Initiated By: Specifies the party that initiated the disengagement (AV System, Test Driver, Remote Operator, or Passenger).
Disengagement Location: Describes the location of the disengagement (Interstate, Freeway, Highway, Rural Road, Street, or Parking Facility).
Description of Facts Causing Disengagement: Provides details about the factors that led to the disengagement.

# Analysis Contents
In this analysis, we explored the disengagement reports to gain insights into the performance and challenges of self-driving technology. The analysis includes:

Data Cleaning: Preprocessing the dataset to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and format the data appropriately.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Examining the distribution and patterns of disengagements based on various factors, such as manufacturer, disengagement location, and the party initiating the disengagement.
Visualization: Creating informative visualizations, including bar plots, pie charts, and maps, to illustrate the key findings from the analysis.
Key Insights: Summarizing the main observations and insights derived from the analysis, highlighting areas where the technology is still struggling.
